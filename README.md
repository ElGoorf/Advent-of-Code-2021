# Advent-of-Code-2021

Advent of code is an annual coding challenge, where each day of advent has a different puzzle to solve, each in two parts.

You can see 2021's puzzles here: https://adventofcode.com/2021

This repository is a collection of my solutions, a folder for each day of the month, with parts 1 and 2 in their own file.
